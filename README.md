# APEX AIOps

APEX AIOps is the Dell solution to bring Artificial Intelligence for IT Operations. APEX AIOps comprises three products:
- Infrastructure Observability (formely named CloudIQ), for proactive health monitoring, recommendations, and predictive analytics for Dell infrastructure systems,
- Application Observability, for full stack application and infrastructure awareness to assure application availability and performance,
- Incident Management (formerly named Moogsoft), for multi-vendor/multicloud infrastructure awareness and remediation to optimize availability of your entire digital infrastructure.

This repository contains a set of artifacts (scripts, code samples, configuration files, etc.) that are related to APEX AIOps, and, more specifically, to Infrastructure Observability and Incident Management integrations (REST API and Webhook). The content of this repository is targeted to System Engineers working with APEX AIOps, DevOps and SRE teams.

Infrastructure Observability and Incident Management integration allow customers to interface with other tools in their ecosystem, from collaboration (ex: Slack, Teams) to ITSM (ex: ServiceNow), in order to automate flows and reduce toil.
