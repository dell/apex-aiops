# Infrastructure Observability

APEX AIOps Infrastructure Observability (previously called CloudIQ) is the AIOps application that provides proactive health monitoring, recommendations, and predictive analytics for Dell infrastructure systems.

This folder contains a set of artifacts (scripts, code samples, configuration files, etc.) that are related to Infrastructure Observability, and, more specifically, to Infrastructure Observability integration (REST API and Webhook). The content of this repository is targeted to DevOps and SRE teams.

Infrastructure Observability integration allows customers to interface Infrastructure Observability with other tools in their ecosystem, from collaboration (ex: Slack, Teams) to ITSM (ex: ServiceNow), in order to automate flows and reduce toil.
